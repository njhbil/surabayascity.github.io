                <h5>RUJAK CINGUR</h5>
                  <p class="card-text justify-content-center">Rujak Cingur is one of Surabaya's most iconic and beloved traditional dishes, known for its unique combination of flavors and textures. The name cingur refers to the key ingredient in the dish, which is sliced beef snout (or cingur in Javanese), mixed with a variety of fresh fruits and vegetables, creating a rich and savory taste that is unlike any other dish. <br>

                    This traditional Javanese salad is served with a special black sauce made from fermented shrimp paste (petis), tamarind, palm sugar, peanuts, and chili, which gives the dish its signature sweet, spicy, and tangy flavor. The sauce is what makes rujak cingur distinct from other Indonesian salads, offering a deep, earthy taste that balances perfectly with the freshness of the fruits and vegetables. <br>
                    
                    A typical serving of rujak cingur includes slices of boiled vegetables such as water spinach (kangkung), bean sprouts, and cucumber, along with tropical fruits like young mango, pineapple, and jicama. The beef snout adds a chewy texture, making each bite a flavorful and complex experience. The dish is often garnished with crunchy fried krupuk (crackers) and can be enjoyed as a light snack or a fulfilling meal. <br>
                    
                    Rujak cingur is more than just a dish; it’s a cultural symbol of Surabaya, reflecting the city's rich culinary heritage. Locals have enjoyed this dish for generations, and it continues to be a favorite among food lovers both in Surabaya and beyond. Whether served in street stalls or traditional restaurants, rujak cingur offers a unique taste of Surabaya's vibrant food culture that shouldn’t be missed by anyone visiting the city. <br></p>

                <h5>LONTONG BALAP</h5>
                  <p class="card-text">Lontong Balap is a famous traditional dish from Surabaya, known for its savory flavors and distinctive ingredients. This dish consists of lontong (compressed rice cakes) served with bean sprouts, fried tofu, lentho (fried mashed black-eyed peas), and a flavorful broth, all topped with crispy fried shallots and a drizzle of soy sauce. It is often enjoyed with sate kerang (skewers of marinated clams) as a side dish, adding an extra layer of richness to the meal. <br>

                    The name “Lontong Balap” literally translates to "rice cake race," which comes from the way the dish was traditionally sold by street vendors who would rush (or “race”) to their selling spots, carrying their large pots of lontong and ingredients in a hurry to serve hungry customers. This lively history adds a charming cultural element to the dish, making it more than just a meal but a part of Surabaya’s culinary folklore. <br>
                    
                    One of the highlights of lontong balap is the broth. Made from a light, flavorful soup of garlic and shallots, it perfectly complements the soft, tender lontong and the crunchy bean sprouts. The lentho adds a slightly nutty and crispy contrast to the dish, while the fried tofu soaks up the broth’s flavors, creating a satisfying combination of textures and tastes. <br>
                    
                    For an authentic Surabayan experience, locals often enjoy lontong balap with a generous splash of chili sauce for some heat, and a bit of petis (fermented shrimp paste) to enhance the savory depth. The dish is typically served hot, making it a perfect choice for a hearty lunch or dinner. <br>
                    
                    Lontong balap remains a beloved staple in Surabaya’s street food scene, capturing the essence of the city’s rich culinary traditions. Whether at a roadside stall or a local restaurant, this dish is a must-try for anyone looking to explore the true flavors of Surabaya. <br></p>

            <h5>TAHU TEK</h5>
              <p class="card-text">Tahu Tek is a beloved street food dish from Surabaya, renowned for its simple yet flavorful combination of fried tofu (tahu) and boiled potatoes, served with a savory and slightly spicy peanut sauce. The dish gets its name from the sound "tek tek," which refers to the sound made by street vendors as they strike a wooden block to announce their presence while selling the dish. <br>

                A typical serving of Tahu Tek consists of bite-sized pieces of crispy fried tofu, boiled potatoes, fresh bean sprouts, cucumber slices, and sometimes eggs. All of these ingredients are generously doused in a thick, rich peanut sauce made with ground peanuts, garlic, soy sauce, and petis (fermented shrimp paste), giving the dish a distinctive sweet, savory, and slightly spicy flavor. The sauce is the star of the dish, its bold and aromatic taste perfectly complementing the simple ingredients. <br>
                
                One of the defining characteristics of Tahu Tek is its texture. The contrast between the crispy exterior of the fried tofu, the softness of the potatoes, and the crunch of the fresh vegetables makes every bite satisfying and exciting. The dish is often topped with krupuk (crackers), adding an extra layer of crunch, and finished with a sprinkle of fried shallots for added flavor. <br>
                
                Petis is a key ingredient that sets Tahu Tek apart from other Indonesian peanut-based dishes, infusing the sauce with a unique umami depth that is characteristic of Surabaya’s local cuisine. The dish is typically enjoyed with a squeeze of lime and a side of chili for those who prefer a spicier kick. <br>
                
                Tahu Tek is a simple, affordable, and filling dish that can be found in street stalls throughout Surabaya, especially in the evenings. It is a favorite among locals for its comforting flavors and quick preparation, making it an ideal choice for a satisfying meal on the go. Whether you're a visitor or a Surabaya native, Tahu Tek is a must-try dish that showcases the city’s culinary diversity and rich street food culture. <br></p>

      <h5>TAHU CAMPUR</h5>
        <p class="card-text">Tahu Campur is a traditional Surabayan dish that offers a flavorful combination of textures and tastes, blending savory, sweet, and spicy elements in one satisfying meal. The name Tahu Campur translates to “mixed tofu,” as the dish brings together various ingredients, with fried tofu (tahu) as the main component. <br>

          A typical serving of Tahu Campur includes fried tofu, lontong (compressed rice cakes), lentho (fried mashed black-eyed peas), bean sprouts, water spinach (kangkung), and crispy crackers (krupuk). What truly makes this dish stand out is the rich, fragrant beef broth that is poured over the mix, creating a warm and comforting soup. The broth is often cooked with tender cuts of beef or beef tripe, adding a savory depth that ties the entire dish together. <br>
          
          One of the signature flavors of Tahu Campur comes from the inclusion of petis (fermented shrimp paste), which is blended into the broth or sauce, giving the dish its distinctive umami flavor. This, combined with the garlic and spices in the broth, creates a deliciously complex taste that is both earthy and robust. <br>
          
          The contrast in textures is another highlight of Tahu Campur. The soft, chewy tofu, crunchy vegetables, and crispy krupuk provide a delightful mouthfeel in every bite. Some variations of the dish may also include boiled potatoes, adding an extra layer of heartiness. <br>
          
          Tahu Campur is often enjoyed with a side of sambal (chili paste) for those who prefer a spicier version, and a squeeze of lime to brighten up the flavors. This comforting and nutritious dish is commonly found at street food stalls in Surabaya, making it a favorite among locals looking for a satisfying meal after a long day. <br>
          
          Rich in flavor and deeply rooted in Surabaya’s culinary heritage, Tahu Campur represents the city’s unique ability to blend simple, everyday ingredients into a harmonious and delicious dish. It is a must-try for anyone seeking to experience the authentic taste of Surabaya’s street food culture. <br></p>
